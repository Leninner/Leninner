# Hi, I'm Lenin

I'm a Full Stack developer.

A year ago, I loved Frontend development, but recently I fell in love with 🥳🥳 cloud and backend development.

My current stack includes 🔧 NextJs for front-end, 🔧 NestJs for back-end, 🔧 AWS for cloud deployment, and 🔧 PostgresSQL and MongoDB for data storage. I use 🔧 Typescript to write better code.

What inspires me the most is the future 🚀 and the cloud ☁️. The good salary 💰 and the chance to grow and meet people from many countries 🌎 also motivate me to keep improving and learning every day.

When I'm not coding, I love spending time with my 😻 cats, exploring the great outdoors on my 🚲 bicycle, and keeping up with the latest 💻📱 technology.

| Technology | Proficiency |

| Next.js | Advanced |
