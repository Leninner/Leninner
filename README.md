# Hi, I'm Lenin! 👋

I'm a Full Stack developer. 

A year ago, I loved Frontend development, but in recent months I've had the opportunity to learn about the cloud and backend development, and I fell in love with it 🥳🥳. 

Now, I enjoy building applications that run smoothly in the cloud and writing scalable, easy-to-maintain code. I'm always looking to learn more and improve my skills! 📚💻

## My current stack

For the front-end, I use **NextJs** which is a great **React** framework that makes it easy for me to build high-performance and **SEO-friendly** web apps. 🚀 It's so satisfying to see my work come to life on the screen! 💻

On the back-end, I rely on **NestJs**, which is a powerful Node.js framework that helps me build scalable and maintainable applications. 🔧 It's great to have a suite of tools that makes my job easier and allows me to focus on writing clean, efficient code. 💻

I also work a lot with **AWS**, using services like **CloudFormation, Lambdas, EC2, and Lightsail** to deploy and manage my applications in the cloud. ☁️ This gives me the flexibility and scalability that I need to make sure my apps are running smoothly. 🚀

When it comes to data storage, I use both **PostgresSQL and MongoDB**. They're both great database technologies that allow me to store and manage large amounts of data with ease. 🗄️

Finally, I use **Typescript** to write better code. It adds some really useful features like static typing, which helps me catch errors before they even happen. 🐞

Overall, I'm really happy with the stack of technologies I get to work with, and I'm always eager **to learn more and improve my skills**. 📚


## What inspires me

What inspires me the most is the future 🚀, especially the cloud ☁️ and the opportunities it offers. In addition, the good salary 💰 and the chance to grow and meet people from many countries 🌎 motivate me to keep improving and learning every day.

## What I loved

👋 Hi there! As an avid 😻 lover of all things beautiful and inspiring, I find myself drawn to a few key passions in life. First and foremost, 🐱 cats hold a special place in my heart, and I can't resist their charm and grace. 

When I'm not spending time with my feline friends, I love nothing more than exploring the great outdoors on my trusty 🚲 bicycle, taking in the stunning 🌄 landscapes and refreshing my soul. 

And when I'm back inside, I'm always eager to dive into the latest and greatest 🖥️ technology, from powerful 💻 laptops to cutting-edge 📱 smartphones, that helps me stay connected and productive.
